  MibewMob Server Extenstion 
  
 1003 - August 24, 2014
  -------------------
  [!] IMPORTANT! Blocked access of API from clients that don't provide a valid API version.
      This means that once this version is installed, older clients that call the API without
      without a proper API version will break. They will not be able to access the API.
      Supported Android client versions are 1.0.0.22+
  [+] Added support for synchronizing canned messages to the server
  [!] Fixed the php code to remove bugs that issue warnings and notices. On some servers with 
  	  "display_errors" on, these notices are prepended to the JSON output causing the 
  	  client to fail to parse the response.
  
 1002 - July 7, 2014
  -------------------
  [!] Validated that MibewMob works with Mibew version 1.6.12 
  [!] Changed the extension and API version number to a straight integer scheme.
  [+] Laid the groundwork to address some privacy issues using API v1002
      - Enforcing the client to provide an API version number to access the API
      - For now, older clients can still access the API without a version number,
        this should change with the next release when the deprecated APIs will be 
        deleted
  [+] Using POST to send the operatorâ€™s messages to the server. The first version
      used GET instead.
  [+] Provided the foundation to sync server settings and operator info when they
      change on the server.
